## OUTLIER DETECTION ANALYSIS
#### Case Study: Ensuring Election Integrity
In the recently concluded election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has faced multiple legal challenges concerning the integrity and accuracy of the election results. Allegations of vote manipulation and irregularities have been widespread, prompting a thorough investigation into the matter.
My mission is to help uncover potential voting irregularities and ensure the transparency of the election results. I will achieve this by identifying outlier polling units where the voting results deviate significantly from neighbouring units, indicating potential influences or rigging. 

#### Task Overview
In this stage, identifying outlier polling units based on the votes each party received. The analysis will involve geospatial techniques to find neighbouring polling units and calculate an outlier score for each party in each unit. The goal is to pinpoint polling units where the voting results significantly deviate from their neighbours, indicating potential irregularities or influences.
#### Task Objectives
 Dataset Preparation: Dataset containing Anambra State past election data was downloaded from the drive provided by HNG Internship. The latitude and longitude was added using geocoding techniques.
